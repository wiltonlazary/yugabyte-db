Following are the key areas of differences between YugabyteDB and [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/).

## 1. Simpler Software Stack

HBase relies on HDFS (another complex piece of infrastructure for data replication) and on Zookeeper for leader election, failure detection, and so on. Running HBase smoothly requires a lot of on-going operational overheads.

## 2. High Availability / Fast-Failover

In HBase, on a region-server death, the unavailability window of shards/regions
on the server can be in the order of 60 seconds or more. This is because the HBase master first
needs to wait for the serverâ€™s ephemeral node in Zookeeper to expire, followed by time take to split
the transaction logs into per-shard recovery logs, and the time taken to replay the edits from the
transaction log by a new server before the shard is available to take IO. In contrast, in Yugabyte,
the tablet-peers are hot standbys, and within a matter of few heartbeats (about few seconds) detect
failure of the leader, and initiate leader election.

## 3. C++ Implementation

Avoids GC tuning; can run better on large memory machines.
Richer data model: Yugabyte offers a multi-model/multi-API through CQL & Redis (and SQL in future).
Rather than deal with just byte keys and values, Yugabyte offers a rich set of scalar (int, text,
decimal, binary, timestamp, etc.) and composite types (such as collections, UDTs, etc.).

## 4. Multi-Datacenter deployment

Flexlible deployment choices across multiple DCs or availability zones. HBase provides
strong-consistency only within a single datacenter and offers only async replication alternative for
cross-DC deployments.
