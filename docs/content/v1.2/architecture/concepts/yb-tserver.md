The YB-TServer (short for Yugabyte Tablet Server) is the process that does the actual IO for end
user requests. Recall from the previous section that data for a table is split/sharded into tablets.
Each tablet is composed of one or more tablet-peers depending on the replication factor. And each
YB-TServer hosts one or more tablet-peers.

Note: We will refer to the “tablet-peers hosted by a YB-TServer” simply as the “tablets hosted by a
YB-TServer”.

Below is a pictorial illustration of this in the case of a 4 node Yugabyte universe, with one table
that has 16 tablets and a replication factor of 3.

The tablet-peers corresponding to each tablet hosted on different YB-TServers form a Raft group and
replicate data between each other. The system shown above comprises of 16 independent Raft groups.
The details of this replication are covered in a previous section on replication.

Within each YB-TServer, there is a lot of cross-tablet intelligence built in to maximize resource
efficiency. Below are just some of the ways the YB-TServer coordinates operations across tablets
hosted by it:

### Server-global block cache

The block cache is shared across the different tablets in a given
YB-TServer. This leads to highly efficient memory utilization in cases when one tablet is read more
often than others. For example, one table may have a read-heavy usage pattern compared to
others. The block cache will automatically favor blocks of this table as the block cache is global
across all tablet-peers.

### Throttled Compactions 

The compactions are throttled across tablets in a given YB-TServer to
prevent compaction storms. This prevents the often dreaded high foreground latencies during a
compaction storm.

### Small/Large Compaction Queues

Compactions are prioritized into large and small compactions with
some prioritization to keep the system functional even in extreme IO patterns.

### Server-global Memstore Limit 

Tracks and enforces a global size across the memstores for
different tablets. This makes sense when there is a skew in the write rate across tablets. For
example, the scenario when there are tablets belonging to multiple tables in a single YB-TServer and
one of the tables gets a lot more writes than the other tables. The write heavy table is allowed to
grow much larger than it could if there was a per-tablet memory limit, allowing good write
efficiency.

### Auto-Sizing of Block Cache/Memstore

The block cache and memstores represent some of the larger
memory-consuming components. Since these are global across all the tablet-peers, this makes memory
management and sizing of these components across a variety of workloads very easy. In fact, based on
the RAM available on the system, the YB-TServer automatically gives a certain percentage of the
total available memory to the block cache, and another percentage to memstores.

### Striping tablet load uniformly across data disks 

On multi-SSD machines, the data (SSTable) and
WAL (RAFT write-ahead-log) for various tablets of tables are evenly distributed across the attached
disks on a **per-table basis**. This ensures that each disk handles an even amount of load for each
table.
