## Synopsis
<b>`TSGET key timestamp`</b><br>
This command fetches the value for the given `timestamp` in the time series that is specified by the
given `key`.

<li>If the given `key` or `timestamp` does not exist, nil is returned.</li>
<li>If the given `key` is associated with non-timeseries data, an error is raised.</li>
<li>If the given `timestamp` is not a valid signed 64 bit integer, an error is raised.</li>

## Return Value
Returns the value for the given `timestamp`

## Examples

The timestamp can be arbitrary integers used just for sorting values in a certain order.
```sh
$ TSADD cpu_usage 10 "70"
```

```
"OK"
```

```sh
$ TSADD cpu_usage 20 "80" 30 "60" 40 "90"
```

```
"OK"
```

We could also encode the timestamp as “yyyymmddhhmm”, since this would still produce integers that are sortable by the actual timestamp.

```sh
$ TSADD cpu_usage 201710311100 "50"
```

```
"OK"
```

A more common option would be to specify the timestamp as the unix timestamp.
```sh
$ TSADD cpu_usage 1509474505 "75"
```

```
"OK"
```

```sh
$ TSGET cpu_usage 10
```

```
"70"
```

```sh
$ TSGET cpu_usage 100
```

```
(nil)
```

```sh
$ TSGET cpu_usage 201710311100
```

```
"50"
```

```sh
$ TSGET cpu_usage 1509474505
```

```
"75"
```
An error is returned when the timestamp is not an int64.

```sh
$ TSGET cpu_usage xyz
```

```
(error) Request was unable to be processed from server.
```
