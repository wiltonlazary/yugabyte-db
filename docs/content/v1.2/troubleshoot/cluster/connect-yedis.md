## 1. Are YugabyteDB processes running?

First, ensure that the expected YugabyteDB processes on the current node.
At a minimum, the tserver process needs to be running to be able to connect to this node with a Redis client or application.
Additionally, depending on the setup, you might expect a master process to also be running on this node.
Follow the instructions on the [Check Processes](../../nodes/check-processes/) page.

## 2. Is the Redis-compatible YEDIS API running?

If the tserver process is running, make sure the the YEDIS API is enabled and listening on the Redis port (default `6379`).

```sh
$ lsof -i :6379
```
```
COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
yb-tserve 81590 centos   92u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP localhost:6379 (LISTEN)
```

Note: You may need to install `lsof` first.

When running a local cluster with `yb-ctl` you should see all the nodes here with different IPs. For instance:

```sh
$ lsof -i :6379
```
```
COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
yb-tserve 81590 centos   92u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP localhost:6379 (LISTEN)
yb-tserve 81593 centos   92u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.2:6379 (LISTEN)
yb-tserve 81596 centos   92u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.3:6379 (LISTEN)
```
If there is another process using this port you might need to stop that and restart the tserver process.
Otherwise, if no process is listening but the tserver is running, check the value of the `--redis_proxy_bind_address` flag passed to the 
tserver process.

## 3. Can redis-cli connect locally?

Use `redis-cli` to connect to the local node.
You may need to install `redis-cli`, otherwise you can find it in the Yugabyte bin directory). 
Try running:

```sh
$ ./redis-cli -h <yb-local-address>
```
where `<yb-local-address>` is the address where the YEDIS service is listening (e.g. as returned by `lsof`). For instance, in the example above, it is `localhost` (or, additionally, `127.0.0.2` and `127.0.0.3` for the `yb-ctl` case).

If `redis-cli` can connect, the issue is likely a network issue with the original client not being able to access this node where YugabyteDB is running. See also [Cannot access Master or TServer Endpoints](#cannot-access-master-or-tserver-endpoints) below.
Otherwise, you might need to run `./yb-admin --master_addresses <master-ip-addresses> setup_redis_table"`. You can find the `yb-admin` tool in the Yugabyte `bin` directory.
