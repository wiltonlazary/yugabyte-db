### Docker Swarm

Instructions for running YugabyteDB on Docker Swarm are available [here](../../../deploy/docker-swarm/).

### Mesosphere DC/OS

Integration with Mesosphere DC/OS is in the works.

## On Virtual Machines and Bare Metal

### Terraform

Instructions for running YugabyteDB on AWS using Terraform are available [here](../../../deploy/public-clouds/aws/#terraform).

## Using Enterprise Edition

[YugabyteDB Enterprise](../../../deploy/enterprise-edition/) has a built-in orchestration engine that manages multiple YugabyteDB universes (including Read Replicas) on the infrastructure layer and platform of your choice.
