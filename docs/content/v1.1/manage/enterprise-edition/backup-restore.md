This section will describe how to backup and restore tables using the Yugabyte Admin Console.

## Create Universe

First, create a universe similar to steps shown in [Create Universe](../create-universe-multi-zone).
For the purposes of this demo we create a 1 node cluster that looks something like this. 

![Create Universe 1 Node](/images/ee/br-create-universe.png) 

Wait for the universe to become ready.

## Setting Storage for Backup

In this example, we create a local directory on the tserver to backup to. Select the
`Connect` modal in the `Nodes` tab of the universe and select the server from Admin Host.

Once you are sshed in, create a directory `/backup` and change the owner to yugabyte.

```sh
$ sudo mkdir /backup; sudo chown yugabyte /backup
```

Note that when there are more than 1 nodes, an nfs mounted on each server is recommended, and
creating a local backup folder on each server will not work.

## Backup

Now, select `Configuration` on the left panel, select the `Backup` tab on top, click `NFS` and enter
`/backup` as the NFS Storage Path before selecting `Save`.

Now, go to the `Backups` tab. There, click on `Create Backup`. A modal should appear where you can 
enter the table (this demo uses the default redis table) and NFS Storage option.

Select `OK`. If you refresh the page, you'll eventually see a completed task.

## Restore

On that same completed task, click on the `Actions` dropdown and click on `Restore Backup`. 
You will see a modal where you can select the universe, keyspace, and table you want to restore to. Enter in
values like this (making sure to change the table name you restore to) and click `OK`.

If you now go to the `Tasks` tab, you will eventually see a completed `Restore Backup` task. To
confirm this worked, go to the `Tables` tab to see both the original table and the table you
restored to.
