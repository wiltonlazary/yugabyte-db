Data manipulation language (DML) statements are used to read from and write to the existing database objects. Currently, YugabyteDB implicitly commits any updates by DML statements.

[`INSERT`](../dml_insert) | Insert rows into a table |
[`SELECT`](../dml_select) | Select rows from a table |
[`UPDATE`](../dml_update) | Will be added. Update rows in a table |
[`DELETE`](../dml_delete) | Will be added. Delete rows from a table |
