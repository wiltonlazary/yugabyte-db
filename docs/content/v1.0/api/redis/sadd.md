## Synopsis
<b>`SADD key value [value ...]`</b><br>
This command adds one or more given values to the set that is associated with the given `key`.

<li>If the `key` is associated with a value that is not a set, an error is raised.</li>
<li>If a specified `value` already exists in the given set, that `value` is ignored and not counted toward the total of newly added members.</li>
