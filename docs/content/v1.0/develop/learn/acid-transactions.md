A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction has four key properties - **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation** and **Durability** - commonly abbreviated as ACID.

- **Atomicity** All the work in a transaction is treated as a single atomic unit - either all of it is performed or none of it is.

- **Consistency** A completed transaction leaves the database in a consistent internal state. This can either be all the operations in the transactions succeeding or none of them succeeding.

- **Isolation** This property determines how/when changes made by one transaction become visible to the other. For example, a *serializable* isolation level guarantees that two concurrent transactions appear as if one executed after the other (i.e. as if they occur in a completely isolated fashion). Currently, YugabyteDB supports *Snapshot Isolation*, and *Serializable* isolation level is in progress. Read more about the different [levels of isolation](../../../architecture/transactions/isolation-levels/).

- **Durability** The results of the transaction are permanently stored in the system. The modifications must persist even in the instance of power loss or system failures.
