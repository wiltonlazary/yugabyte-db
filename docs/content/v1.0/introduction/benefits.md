## Agile application development

### 1. Zero data loss writes and low-latency, always-on reads

Default single-row ACID operations with optional distributed ACID transactions when needed. Multiple read consistency levels to serve latency-sensitive applications. 

### 3. High performance

A ground-up C++ implementation combined with 3x read throughput compared to simple quorum-based consistency of traditional NoSQL.

### 3. Popular APIs and mature ecosystems

Choose between 2 popular NoSQL APIs rather than learn a new proprietary language, even port existing applications fast by leveraging the maturity of these ecosystems. SQL support is in the works.

### 4. Converged caching

Avoid explicit management of the memory and consistency associated with an independent cache that typically fronts a persistent database.

## Cloud-native technical operations

### 1. Multi-region/multi-cloud deployments simplified

Geo-redundant deployments across multiple availability zones and regions on public/private/hybrid clouds as well as on-premises datacenters.

### 2. Zero downtime and zero data loss operations 

Highly available under any unplanned infrastructure failure as well as any planned software or hardware upgrade.

### 3. Simple scalability

Linear, fast & reliable scalability from 1 to 1000s nodes with automatic sharding and rebalancing. Use Kubernetes for orchestration of dev/test workloads.

### 4. Hardware flexibility

Seamlessly move from one type of compute and storage to another for cost and performance reasons.
