YugabyteDB can be configured to use multiple storage disks by setting the [`--fs_data_dirs`](../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver.md) configuration option.
This introduces the possibility of disk failure and recovery issues.

## Cluster replication recovery
The `yb-tserver` service automatically detects disk failures and attempts to spread the data from the failed disk to other healthy nodes in the cluster.
In a single-zone setup with a replication factor (RF) of `3`: if you started with four nodes or more, 
then there would be at least three nodes left after one failed. 
In this case, rereplication is automatically started if a YB-TServer or disk is down for 10 minutes.

In a multi-zone setup with a replication factor (RF) of `3`: YugabyteDB will try to keep one copy of data per zone. 
In this case, for automatic rereplication of data, a zone needs to have at least two YB-TServers so that if one fails, 
its data can be rereplicated to the other. Thus, this would mean at least a six-node cluster.

## Failed disk replacement
The steps to replace a failed disk are:

1. Stop the YB-TServer node.
2. Replace the disks that have failed.
3. Restart the `yb-tserver` service.

On restart, the YB-TServer will see the new empty disk and start replicating tablets from other nodes.
