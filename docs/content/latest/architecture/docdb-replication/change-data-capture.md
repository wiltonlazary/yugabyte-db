Change data capture (CDC) in YugabyteDB provides technology to ensure that any changes in data (inserts, updates, and deletions) are identified, captured, and automatically applied to another data repository instance or made available for consumption by applications and other tools.

## Use cases

Change data capture is useful in a number of scenarios, such as the ones described here.

### Microservice-oriented architectures

Some microservices require a stream of changes to the data and using CDC in YugabyteDB can provide consumable data changes to CDC subscribers.

### Asynchronous replication to remote systems

Remote systems may subscribe to a stream of data changes and then transform and consume the changes. Maintaining separate database instances for transactional and reporting purposes can be used to manage workload performance.

### Multiple data center strategies

Maintaining multiple data centers enables enterprises to provide:

- High availability (HA) — Redundant systems help ensure that your operations virtually never fail.
- Geo-redundancy — Geographically dispersed servers provide resiliency against catastrophic events and natural disasters.

Two data center (2DC), or dual data center, deployments are a common use of CDC that allows efficient management of two YugabyteDB universes that are geographically separated. For more information, see [Two data center (2DC) deployments](../async-replication) and [Replicate between two data centers](../../../deploy/multi-dc/2dc-deployment)

### Compliance and auditing

Auditing and compliance requirements can require you to use CDC to maintain records of data changes.

In the sections below, the terms "data center", "cluster", and "universe" are used interchangeably. We assume here that each YB universe is deployed in a single data center.

### CDC streams

Creating a new CDC stream on a table returns a stream UUID. The CDC Service stores information about all streams in the system table `cdc_streams`. The schema for this table looks like this:

```
cdc_streams {
stream_id  text,
params     map<text, text>,
primary key (stream_id)
}
```

### CDC subscribers

Along with creating a CDC stream, a CDC subscriber is also created for all existing tablets of the stream. A new subscriber entry is created in the `cdc_subscribers` table. The schema for this table is:

```
cdc_subscribers {
stream_id      text,
subscriber_id  text,
tablet_id      text,
data           map<text, text>,
primary key (stream_id, subscriber_id, tablet_id)
}
```

### CDC service APIs

Every YB-TServer has a `CDC service` that is stateless. The main APIs provided by `CDC Service` are:

- `SetupCDC` API — Sets up a CDC stream for a table.
- `RegisterSubscriber` API — Registers a CDC subscriber that will read changes from some, or all, tablets of the CDC stream.
- `GetChanges` API – Used by CDC subscribers to get the latest set of changes.
- `GetSnapshot` API — Used to bootstrap CDC subscribers and get the current snapshot of the database (typically will be invoked prior to GetChanges)

### Pushing changes to external systems

Each YugabyteDB's TServer has CDC subscribers (`cdc_subscribers`) that are responsible for getting changes for all tablets for which the TServer is a leader. When a new stream and subscriber are created, the TServer `cdc_subscribers` detects this and starts invoking the `cdc_service.GetChanges` API periodically to get the latest set of changes.

While invoking `GetChanges`, the CDC subscriber needs to pass in a `from_checkpoint` which is the last `OP ID` that it successfully consumed. When the CDC service receives a request of `GetChanges` for a tablet, it reads the changes from the WAL (log cache) starting from `from_checkpoint`, deserializes them and returns those to CDC subscriber. It also records the `from_checkpoint` in `cdc_subscribers` table in the data column. This will be used for bootstrapping fallen subscribers who don’t know the last checkpoint or in case of tablet leader changes.

When `cdc_subscribers` receive the set of changes, they then push these changes out to Kafka.

### CDC guarantees

#### Per-tablet ordered delivery guarantee

All data changes for one row, or multiple rows in the same tablet, will be received in the order in which they occur. Due to the distributed nature of the problem, however, there is no guarantee for the order across tablets.

For example, let us imagine the following scenario:

- Two rows are being updated concurrently.
- These two rows belong to different tablets.
- The first row `row #1` was updated at time `t1` and the second row `row #2` was updated at time `t2`.

In this case, it is possible for CDC to push the later update corresponding to `row #2` change to Kafka before pushing the earlier update, corresponding to `row #1`.

#### At-least-once delivery

Updates for rows will be pushed at least once. With "at-least-once" delivery, you will never lose a message, but might end up being delivered to a CDC consumer more than once. This can happen in case of tablet leader change, where the old leader already pushed changes to Kafka, but the latest pushed `op id` was not updated in `cdc_subscribers` table.

For example, imagine a CDC client has received changes for a row at times t1 and t3. It is possible for the client to receive those updates again.

#### No gaps in change stream

When you have received a change for a row for timestamp `t`, you will not receive a previously unseen change for that row from an earlier timestamp. This guarantees that receiving any change implies that all earlier changes have been received for a row.
