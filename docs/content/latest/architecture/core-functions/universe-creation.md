## Step 1. Start YB-Masters

When creating a YugabyteDB universe, the first step is to bring up sufficient YB-Masters (as many as
the replication factor) with each being told about the others. These YB-Masters initialize themselves with a unique
UUID, learn about each other and perform a leader election. At the end of this step, one of the masters establishes itself as the leader.

## Step 2. Start YB-TServers

The next step is to start as many YB-TServers as there are nodes, with the master addresses being
passed to them on startup. They start heart-beating to the masters, communicating the fact that they
are alive. The heartbeats also communicate the tablets the YB-TServers are currently hosting and
their load, but no tablets would exist in the system yet.

## An example

Let us illustrate this with our usual example of creating a 4-node YugabyteDB universe with a
replication factor of 3. In order to do so, first the three masters are started in the create mode
instructing them to that this is a brand new universe create. This is done explicitly to prevent
accidental errors in creating a universe while it is already running.

The next step, the masters learn about each other and elect one leader.

The YB-TServers are then started, and they all heartbeat to the YB-Master.
