The `yb-ctl` utility, located in the bin directory of YugabyteDB home, provides a simple command line interface for administering local clusters used for development and learning. It invokes the [`yb-master`](../reference/configuration/yb-master/) and [`yb-tserver`](../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/) binaries to perform the necessary administration.

## Syntax

Run `yb-ctl` commands from the YugabyteDB home directory.

```sh
./bin/yb-ctl [ command ] [ argument, argument2, ... ]
```

### Online help

To display the online help, run `yb-ctl --help` from the YugabyteDB home directory.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl --help
```

## Commands

and [Wipe and restart with placement info flags](#wipe-and-restart-with-placement-info-flags).

### --replication_factor | -rf

Specifies the number of replicas for each tablet. Should be an odd number of least `3` or  (for example, `3` or `5`) so that a majority consensus can be established.

Replication factor for the cluster as well as default number of YB-Master services.

Default: `1`

### --require_clock_sync

Specifies whether YugabyteDB requires clock synchronization between the nodes in the cluster.

Default: `false`

### --num_shards_per_tserver

### --timeout-processes-running-sec

Timeout, in seconds, for operations that wait on the cluster.

### --verbose

Flag to log internal debug messages to `stderr`.
  
### --install-if-needed

With this option, if YugabyteDB is not yet installed on the system, the latest version will be downloaded and installed automatically.

## Create a local cluster

To quickly create a local YugabyteDB cluster for development and learning, use the `yb-ctl create` command.

In order to ensure that all of the replicas for a given tablet can be placed on different nodes, the number of nodes created with the initial create command is always equal to the replication factor.  To expand or shrink the cluster, use the [`add_node`](#add-nodes) and [`remove_node`](#stop-remove-nodes) commands.

Each of these initial nodes run a `yb-tserver` service and a `yb-master` service. Note that the number of YB-Master services in a cluster must equal the replication factor for the cluster to be considered operating normally.

### Create a local 1-node cluster with replication factor of 1

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl create
```

Note that the default replication factor is 1.

### Create a 4-node cluster with replication factor of 3

First create 3-node cluster with replication factor of `3`.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl --rf 3 create
```

Use `yb-ctl add_node` command to add a node and make it a 4-node cluster.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl add_node
```

### Create a 5-node cluster with replication factor of 5

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl --rf 5 create
```

## Default directories for local clusters

YugabyteDB clusters created with the `yb-ctl` utility are created locally on the same host and simulate a distributed multi-host cluster.

### Data directory

YugabyteDB cluster data is installed in `$HOME/yugabyte-data/`, containing the following:

```sh
cluster_config.json
initdb.log
node-#/
node-#/disk-#/
```

#### Node directories

For each simulated YugabyteDB node, a `yugabyte-data` subdirectory, named `node-#` (where # is the number of the node), is created.

Example: `/yugabyte-data/node-#/`

Each `node-#` directory contains the following:

```sh
yugabyte-data/node-#/disk-#/
```

#### Disk directories

For each simulated disk, a `disk-#` subdirectory is created in each `/yugabyte-data/node-#` directory.

Each `disk-#` directory contains the following:

```sh
master.err
master.out
pg_data/
tserver.err
tserver.out
yb-data/
```

### Logs

YB-Master logs are added in the following location:

```sh
yugabyte-data/node-#/disk-#/yb-data/master.out
yugabyte-data/node-#/disk-#/yb-data/master/logs
```

YB-TServer logs are added in the following location:

```sh
yugabyte-data/node-#/disk-#/yb-data/tserver.out
yugabyte-data/node-#/disk-#/yb-data/tserver/logs
```

## Start and stop an existing cluster

Start the existing cluster, or create and start a cluster (if one doesn't exist) by running the `yb-ctl start` command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl start

```

Stop a cluster so that you can start it later by running the `yb-ctl stop` command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl stop
```

## Check cluster status

To get the status of your local cluster, including the Admin UI URLs for the YB-Master and YB-TServer, run the `yb-ctl status` command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl status

```

## Initialize the YEDIS API

The `setup_redis` command to initialize YugabyteDB's Redis-compatible YEDIS API.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl setup_redis

```

## Add and remove nodes

### Add nodes

- Adding a new node to the cluster. This will start a new YB-TServer service and give it a new `node_id` for tracking purposes.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl add_node

```

### Stop and remove nodes

We can stop a node by executing the `yb-ctl stop` command. The command takes the node ID of the node
that has to be removed as input. Stop node command expects a node id which denotes the index of the server that needs to be stopped. It also takes an optional flag `--master`, which denotes that the server is a master.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl stop_node 4

```

At this point of time `remove_node` and `stop_node` do the same thing. So they can be used interchangeably.

## Destroy a local cluster

You can use the `yb-ctl destroy` command to destroy a local cluster. This command stops all the nodes and deletes the data directory of the cluster.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl destroy

```

## Advanced commands

### Create a cluster across multiple zones, regions, and clouds

You can pass the placement information for nodes in a cluster from the command line. The placement information is provided as a set of (cloud, region, zone) tuples separated by commas. Each cloud, region and zone entry is separated by dots.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl --rf 3 create --placement_info "cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud2.region2.zone2"

```

The total number of placement information entries cannot be more than the replication factor (this is because we would not be able to satisfy the data placement constraints for this replication factor).
If the total number of placement information entries is lesser than the replication factor, the placement information is passed down to the node in a round robin fashion.

To add a node:

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl add_node --placement_info "cloud1.region1.zone1"

```

### Create a cluster with custom flags

You can also pass custom flags to the YB-Master and YB-TServer services.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl --rf 1 create --master_flags "log_cache_size_limit_mb=128,log_min_seconds_to_retain=20,master_backup_svc_queue_length=70" --tserver_flags "log_inject_latency=false,log_segment_size_mb=128,raft_heartbeat_interval_ms=1000"
```

To add a node with custom YB-TServer flags:

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl add_node --tserver_flags "log_inject_latency=false,log_segment_size_mb=128"
```

To add a node with custom YB-Master flags:

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl add_node --master_flags "log_cache_size_limit_mb=128,log_min_seconds_to_retain=20"
```

### Restart a cluster

The `yb-ctl restart` command can be used to restart a cluster. Please note that if you restart the cluster,
all custom defined flags and placement information will be lost. Nevertheless, you can pass the
placement information and custom flags in the same way as they are passed in the `yb-ctl create` command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart
```

- Restart with cloud, region and zone flags

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart --placement_info "cloud1.region1.zone1" 
```

### Restart with custom flags

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart --master_flags "log_cache_size_limit_mb=128,log_min_seconds_to_retain=20,master_backup_svc_queue_length=70" --tserver_flags "log_inject_latency=false,log_segment_size_mb=128,raft_heartbeat_interval_ms=1000"
```

### Restart a node

The `yb-ctl restart` first stops the node and then starts it again. At this point of time the node is not decommissioned from the cluster. Thus one of the primary advantages of this command is that it can be used to wipe out old flags and pass in new ones. Just like  create, you can pass the cloud/region/zone and custom flags in the `yb-ctl restart` command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart_node 2

```

#### Restart node with placement information

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart_node 2 --placement_info "cloud1.region1.zone1"
```

#### Restart master node

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart_node 2 --master
```

#### Restart node with flags

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl restart_node 2 --master --master_flags "log_cache_size_limit_mb=128,log_min_seconds_to_retain=20"
```

### Wipe and restart a cluster

The `yb-ctl wipe_restart` command stops all the nodes, removes the underlying data directories, and then restarts with the same number of nodes that you had in your previous configuration.

Just like the `yb-ctl restart` command, the custom-defined flags and placement information will be lost during `wipe_restart`, though you can pass placement information and custom flags in the same way as they are passed in the `yb-ctl create` command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl wipe_restart
```

#### Wipe and restart with placement info flags

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl wipe_restart --placement_info "cloud1.region1.zone1" 
```

#### Wipe and restart with custom flags

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl wipe_restart --master_flags "log_cache_size_limit_mb=128,log_min_seconds_to_retain=20,master_backup_svc_queue_length=70" --tserver_flags "log_inject_latency=false,log_segment_size_mb=128,raft_heartbeat_interval_ms=1000"
```
