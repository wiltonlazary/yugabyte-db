The Yugabyte Platform is best fit for mission-critical deployments, such as production or pre-production testing. The Yugabyte Platform console is used in a highly available mode and orchestrates and manages YugabyteDB universes, or clusters, on one or more regions (across public cloud and private on-premises data centers).

Yugabyte Platform is a containerized application that is installed and managed using <a href="https://www.replicated.com/" target="_blank">Replicated</a> for mission-critical environments (for example, production, performance, or failure mode testing). Replicated is a purpose-built tool for on-premises deployments and life cycle management of containerized applications. For environments that are not mission-critical, such as those needed for local development or simple functional testing, you can also use <a href="../../quick-start/install">YugabyteDB</a>.
