- Create a database.

```sql
postgres=> CREATE DATABASE yb_demo;
```

```sql
postgres=> GRANT ALL ON DATABASE yb_demo to postgres;
```

```sql
postgres=> \c yb_demo;
```

- Insert sample data

First create the 4 tables necessary to store the data.

```sql
yb_demo=> \i 'schema.sql';
```

Now load the data into the tables.

```sql
yb_demo=> \i 'data/products.sql'
```

```sql
yb_demo=> \i 'data/users.sql'
```

```sql
yb_demo=> \i 'data/orders.sql'
```

```sql
yb_demo=> \i 'data/reviews.sql'
```

## 2. Simple queries

Lets us look at the schema of the `products` table. You can do this as follows:

```sql
yb_demo=> \d products
```

You should see an output which looks like the following:

```
                    Table "public.products"
   Column   |            Type             | Collation | Nullable |               Default
------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------------------------------
 id         | bigint                      |           | not null | nextval('products_id_seq'::regclass)
 created_at | timestamp without time zone |           |          |
 category   | text                        |           |          |
 ean        | text                        |           |          |
 price      | double precision            |           |          |
 quantity   | integer                     |           |          | 5000
 rating     | double precision            |           |          |
 title      | text                        |           |          |
 vendor     | text                        |           |          |
```

To see how many products there are in this table, you can run the following query.
```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT count(*) FROM products;
```

You should see an output which looks like the following:

```
 count
-------
   200
(1 row)
```

Now let us run a query to select the `id`, `title`, `category` and `price` columns for the first five products.

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT id, title, category, price, rating
          FROM products
          LIMIT 5;
```

You should see an output which looks like the following:

```
 id  |           title            | category |      price       | rating
-----+----------------------------+----------+------------------+--------
  22 | Enormous Marble Shoes      | Gizmo    | 21.4245199604423 |    4.2
  38 | Lightweight Leather Gloves | Gadget   | 44.0462485589292 |    3.8
 162 | Gorgeous Copper Knife      | Gadget   | 22.3785988001101 |    3.3
 174 | Rustic Iron Keyboard       | Gadget   | 74.4095392945406 |    4.4
  46 | Rustic Linen Keyboard      | Gadget   | 78.6996782532274 |      4
(5 rows)
```

To view the next 3 products, we simply add an `OFFSET 5` clause to start from the fifth product.

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT id, title, category, price, rating
          FROM products
          LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5;
```

You should see an output which looks like the following:

```
 id  |           title           | category  |      price       | rating
-----+---------------------------+-----------+------------------+--------
 152 | Enormous Aluminum Clock   | Widget    | 32.5971248660044 |    3.6
   3 | Synergistic Granite Chair | Doohickey | 35.3887448815391 |      4
 197 | Aerodynamic Concrete Lamp | Gizmo     | 46.7640712447334 |    4.6
(3 rows)
```

## 3. JOINs

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. Let us do this by combining some orders with the information of the corresponding users that placed the order.

From the `orders` table, we are going to select the `total` column that represents the total amount the user paid. For each of these orders, we are going to fetch the `id`, the `name` and the `email` from the `users` table of the corresponding users that placed those orders. The related column between the two tables is the user's id. This can be expressed as the following join query:

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT users.id, users.name, users.email, orders.id, orders.total
          FROM orders INNER JOIN users ON orders.user_id=users.id
          LIMIT 10;
```

You should see something like the following:
```
  id  |        name         |             email             |  id   |      total

```

## 4. Distributed transactions

In order to track the quantities accurately, each product being ordered in some quantity by a user has to decrement the corresponding product inventory quantity. These operations should be performed inside a transaction.

Imagine the user with id `1` wants to order for `10` units of the product with id `2`.

Before running the transaction, we can verify that we have `5000` units of product `2` in stock by running the following query:

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT id, category, price, quantity FROM products WHERE id=2;
```

```
SELECT id, category, price, quantity FROM products WHERE id=2;
 id | category  |      price       | quantity
----+-----------+------------------+----------
  2 | Doohickey | 70.0798961307176 |     5000
(1 row)
```


Now, to place the order, we can run the following transaction:

```sql
yb_demo=> BEGIN TRANSACTION;

/* First insert a new order into the orders table. */
INSERT INTO orders
  (id, created_at, user_id, product_id, discount, quantity, subtotal, tax, total)
VALUES (
  (SELECT max(id)+1 FROM orders)                 /* id */,
  now()                                          /* created_at */,
  1                                              /* user_id */,
  2                                              /* product_id */, 
  0                                              /* discount */,
  10                                             /* quantity */,
  (10 * (SELECT price FROM products WHERE id=2)) /* subtotal */,
  0                                              /* tax */,
  (10 * (SELECT price FROM products WHERE id=2)) /* total */
) RETURNING id;

/* Next decrement the total quantity from the products table. */
UPDATE products SET quantity = quantity - 10 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

We can verify that the order got inserted by running the following:

```sql
yb_demo=> select * from orders where id = (select max(id) from orders);
```
```
select * from orders where id = (select max(id) from orders);
  id   |        created_at         | user_id | product_id | discount | quantity |     subtotal     | tax |      total
-------+---------------------------+---------+------------+----------+----------+------------------+-----+------------------
 18762 | 2019-04-07 21:22:36.26783 |       1 |          2 |        0 |       10 | 700.798961307176 |   0 | 700.798961307176
(1 row)
```

We can also verify that total quantity of product id `2` in the inventory is `4990` by running the following query.

```sql
yb_demo=# SELECT id, category, price, quantity FROM products WHERE id=2;
```

```sql
SELECT id, category, price, quantity FROM products WHERE id=2;
 id | category  |      price       | quantity
----+-----------+------------------+----------
  2 | Doohickey | 70.0798961307176 |     4990
(1 row)
```

## 5. Built-in functions

YSQL supports a rich set of built-in functions. In this example, we will look at some functions such as `DISTINCT`, `MIN`, `MAX` and `AVG` in the context of the data set.

- How are users signing up for my site?

To answer this question, we should list the unique set of `source` channels present in the database. This can be achieved as follows:

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT DISTINCT(source) FROM users;
```

```
source
-----------
 Facebook
 Twitter
 Organic
 Affiliate
 Google
(5 rows)
```

- What is the min, max and average price of products in the store?

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price) FROM products;
```

```
min               |       max        |       avg
------------------+------------------+------------------
 15.6919436739704 | 98.8193368436819 | 55.7463996679207
(1 row)
```

## 6. Aggregations

The `GROUP BY` clause is commonly used to perform aggregations. Below are a couple of examples of using these to answer some types of questions about the data.

-  What is the most effective channel for user signups?

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT source, count(*) AS num_user_signups
          FROM users
          GROUP BY source
          ORDER BY num_user_signups DESC;
```

```
source     | num_user_signups
-----------+------------------
 Facebook  |              512
 Affiliate |              506
 Google    |              503
 Twitter   |              495
 Organic   |              484
(5 rows)
```

- What are the most effective channels for product sales by revenue?

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT source, ROUND(SUM(orders.total)) AS total_sales
          FROM users, orders WHERE users.id=orders.user_id
          GROUP BY source
          ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

```
source     | total_sales
-----------+-------------
 Facebook  |      333454
 Google    |      325184
 Organic   |      319637
 Twitter   |      319449
 Affiliate |      297605
(5 rows)
```

## 7. Views

Let us answer the questions below by creating a view.

-  What percentage of the total sales is from the Facebook channel?

```sql
yb_demo=> CREATE VIEW channel AS
            (SELECT source, ROUND(SUM(orders.total)) AS total_sales
             FROM users, orders
             WHERE users.id=orders.user_id
             GROUP BY source
             ORDER BY total_sales DESC);
```

Now that the view is created, we can see it in our list of relations.

```sql
yb_demo=> \d
```

```
List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  |  Owner
--------+----------+-------+----------
 public | channel  | view  | postgres
 public | orders   | table | postgres
 public | products | table | postgres
 public | reviews  | table | postgres
 public | users    | table | postgres
(5 rows)
```

```sql
yb_demo=> SELECT source, 
            total_sales * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_sales) FROM channel) AS percent_sales
          FROM channel
          WHERE source='Facebook';
```

```
source    |  percent_sales
----------+------------------
 Facebook | 20.9018954710909
(1 row)
```
